              <h3>Glimse of Virat Kohli's life:</h3>
              Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] (listen); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.

              Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.

                As of March 2023, Kohli has made 75 centuries and 7 double centuries in international cricket—28 centuries, 7 double centuries in Test cricket, 46 centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs), and 1 century in T20I.[c]
                Kohli holds a prominent place in the annals of Indian cricket. He has the distinction of being the only cricketer to have been named the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup on two separate occasions, in 2014 and 2016.[214] In terms of ODI centuries, he ranks second with 46, behind Sachin Tendulkar who holds the record with 49.[522] Furthermore, in international cricket, Kohli has amassed 75 centuries, once again second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 100 centuries.[523] In 2018, Kohli set a record, becoming the first player to score 1,000 ODI runs in 11 innings in a calendar year.[524] In 2022, he achieved another milestone by scoring 1,000 runs in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, becoming the second player to reach this feat after Mahela Jayawardene.[525] During match against Bangladesh Kohli etched his name for the highest number of runs scored in the tournament.
